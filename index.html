                    #### Selected Accomplishments <!-- markmap: fold -->
                    - Team leadership: Led the robot movement team, which was responsible for all software 
                    related to moving our 7 DOF fryer cooking robot.
                    - Robot behavior platform: Created framework for defining robot behaviors. Notable aspects 
                    of this framework were its well-defined configuration management and automated testing systems.
                    This allowed us to support many configurations with ease.
                    - Motion planning: Responsible for and worked heavily on our path planning stack, including 
                    a custom implementation of Trajopt for kinematics planning and an MPC layer for dynamics 
                    and trajectory smoothing.
                    - Observability platform: Made significant contributions to our observability platform, 
                    including data lake architecture, setting up dashboards/alerts on Grafana and led the 
                    team’s adoption of them.
                    - Academic research engagements: Was the lead facilitator of two collaborations between 
                    Miso and Caltech’s AMBER lab (premier robotics research lab led by prof. Aaron Ames).
                    - Other notables: Computer vision performance engineering, extrinsic camera calibration routine,
                     system identification, scheduling algorithms, custom state machines, and CI/CD architecture.

                    - Co-founder / Chief Product Officer / Lead Software Engineer (Apr 2024 - Dec 2024)
                    #### Selected Accomplishments <!-- markmap: fold -->
                    - AI order taking system: Built a proof-of-concept order taking system for restaurants.
                    A demo of an early version of this system can be seen here. Lots of hands-on experience
                    testing and fine-tuning models, working with data for model training, and designing
                    low-latency and reliable agentic workflows.
                    - Automated testing for AI systems: Built testing framework for the order taking system.
                    This involved automated tests for speech-to-text and order prediction systems.
